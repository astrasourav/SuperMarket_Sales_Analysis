# Supermarket Sales Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing a supermarket sales dataset to uncover key insights and trends. The data includes information about customer transactions, such as the product line, total sales, gender, customer type, and payment methods.

## Project Overview

This analysis covers the following tasks:
1. **Gender Distribution**: Analyzed customer gender distribution and visualized it using a pie chart.
2. **Payment Methods**: Explored the various payment methods used by customers and created a bar chart to show the mode of payment.
3. **Customer Type**: Examined customer type (members vs. normal customers) and visualized the data with a pie chart.
4. **Sales by Product Line**: Calculated the total sales for each product line and visualized it using a bar chart.
5. **Sales by Day of the Week**: Analyzed total sales per day of the week to identify peak shopping days.
6. **Sales by City**: Investigated the total sales in different cities and visualized it using a bar chart.
7. **Average Transaction Size**: Analyzed average transaction size across different categories such as gender, customer type, and payment methods.
8. **Sales per Hour**: Explored sales trends based on the hour of the day and visualized them using a bar chart.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Data analysis and cleaning using `pandas`
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization through various plots and charts
- **Kaggle Notebook**: For writing and running the analysis
- **Kaggle Dataset**: Dataset of supermarket sales

## Insights
- Analyzed the most popular product categories.
- Explored customer behavior based on gender, customer type, and payment methods.

## Future Work
Further analysis can be done to explore correlations between product lines and payment methods or to perform a predictive analysis on customer behavior.
